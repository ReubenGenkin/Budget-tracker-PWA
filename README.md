# Budget-tracker-PWA

## About
This project uses a simple budget tracker applicatiojn to show the functionality of a PWA. Using a service worker
all "transactions" are saved to the cache and loaded again when connectivity is restored allowing full offline usage

## Installation
1. Git clone the repo or copy and paste the files
2. In your Command line Terminal initiate an 'npm install' to download the necessary node modules

## Usage
To test the offline functionality that a PWA offers go into your dev tools and in applicatiojnj set to offline
to see how the site updates the cache offline and updates when the 'interenet' is restored
